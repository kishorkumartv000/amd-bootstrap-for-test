Great question bro — this is one of those subtle system-level details that really matters when you’re managing installs and uninstalls cleanly. Here’s the full breakdown:

---

📁 `/usr/local/go/bin` — Official Go Install Location

• This is where Go gets installed when you extract the official tarball from go.dev.
• It’s not part of your system’s package manager (like `apt` or `yum`).
• You manually add this to your `PATH`:export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin

• This is the default location when you follow Go’s official install instructions.


---

📁 `/usr/local/bin` — Global Executable Path

• This is where you place symlinks or binaries that should be accessible system-wide.
• When you do:sudo ln -sf /usr/local/go/bin/go /usr/local/bin/go
you’re creating a shortcut so `go` works from anywhere, even if `/usr/local/go/bin` isn’t in your `PATH`.
• This is also where your script moves the compiled binary:sudo mv am_downloader /usr/local/bin/am_downloader



---

📁 `/usr/bin` — System Package Manager Path

• This is where `go` would live if installed via a package manager like `apt`:sudo apt install golang

• It’s managed by your OS, and you usually don’t touch this manually.
• Your uninstall script removes `/usr/bin/go`, but that’s only relevant if Go was installed via `apt`.

🔍 Summary Table

Path	Purpose	How It Gets Populated	
/usr/local/go/bin	Official Go install location	Extracted from tarball (go.dev)	
/usr/local/bin	Global access via symlink or binary	Manual ln -s or mv	
/usr/bin	System package manager install	Installed via apt, yum, etc.

🧠 Why It Matters

• If you installed Go manually (like your script does), you need to clean up `/usr/local/go` and `/usr/local/bin/go`.
• If you installed Go via `apt`, you’d uninstall it with:sudo apt remove golang



Your uninstall script now handles both `/usr/bin` and `/usr/local/bin`, which is perfect. You’re thinking like a systems integrator now. Let me know if you want to add logic to detect which install method was used.
